Let me give some more context: \n\nIn portal we use _.extend, which extends only at the first level , this means that if at portal you have { a: xxx, b: yyy} and it receives a { c: zzz } it will extend the original object and result in { a, b, c} . But if the incoming data is { b: 111} then it will override whatever previously existed at portal's b property.  \nWe then have 2 options: 1) extend \"b\" at the client level and always send it complete.  Or 2) do a \"recursive/deep extend\" at portal .  I didn't find this type of recursive extend in \"underscore\" library (although there are some npm modules that we could download and use) .\n\nDo you have a preference to go with 2) approach ? \n ", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Good question, @iche033 .
