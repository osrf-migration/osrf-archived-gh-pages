These configurations are used to reject launch instance requests when the maximum allowed hours is reached by the targetted identity. These configurations are \"targetted\", ie. they have a field \"identity\" that is used to target the instance-hours configuration to any specific user/team/role.\n\n- updated the middleware/reject logic based on the discussion. \n\n- several new tests\n\n@chapulina could you please take a look ?
