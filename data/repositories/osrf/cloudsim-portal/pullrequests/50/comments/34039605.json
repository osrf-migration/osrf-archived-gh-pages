Let me try to share my reasoning here: \n\n- I saw simulators have a list of permissions. These permissions \"usernames\" usually map to individual users or groups/teams .\n\n- At the same time, the request authorized user has a set of identities.\n\n- I assumed there was an intersection of those sets (simulator permissions and user's identities) at some point. So, when the middleware requests the csgrants.userResources , all simulators which are accessible (read/readwrite) by the current user should be returned.\n\nBut you're right in your question/clarification. If somehow the user does not have any access to that simulator, then the time reported for that user would not include it. \nWe can definitely change this, if needed. If we were to do that, then I guess we should query all the simulators for a given team/group  (independently of current user permissions). \nWhat do you think?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Very good question.
