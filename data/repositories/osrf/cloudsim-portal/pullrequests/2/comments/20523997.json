A client socket, so far, doesn't need to emit anything to the portal, correct? It just stands by and listens to status updates which are being continuously sent.\n\n1. Just double checking if I understood all the events:\n\n    * `simulator_launch` is only sent to the user which launched the simulator, which is the only one currently with permission to see it. It is sent after the simulator has been successfully launched and has a valid ID, but this doesn't mean it has an IP or is running already, right?\n\n    * `simulator_terminate` is sent to all the users which have read or write permissions to the simulator. The status says `TERMINATING` because the simulator is being terminated, but the termination isn't complete yet. The complete termination can only be got from `simulator_status`,  saying `TERMINATED`.\n\n    * `simulator_status` is continuously sent to everyone who has read or write permissions to that simulator. The statuses covered in the test are: `LAUNCHING` and `TERMINATED`, but from the code I see that it can also be `RUNNING`, `UNKNOWN` and `TERMINATING`, right? It might be complicated to write tests for all of these, I just wanted to make sure it was clear all the statuses we can have.\n\nGreat tests!
